# Important Notice

This project is an experiment and not a commercial product, bugs can, and most likely will happen. Please report any bugs to a moderator promptly, to ensure they are fixed. Also note that your wallet is not guaranteed, and you may experience issues with your balance. For this reason, it is highly recommended that you do not deposit large amounts, or anything you do not wish to place at risk by being tied to the server. In addition, if you are caught breaking rules and are banned, you forfeit your access to your server wallet, and all funds tied to it. With this said, rules are non-negotiable, and will be strictly enforced. This server is a fair server, and anyone abusing any system set in place will be punished. Please play fair, have fun, and enjoy the server

# Connecting

You need Minecraft: Java version. Windows 10 edition is not supported. To join the server simply connect to:

````
doge.bitquest.org
````

# Your Wallet

A crypto wallet will be automatically created when you join the server for the first time. You can deposit crypto, and you can transfer the currency out of the game to an external wallet at any time. 

## Adding DOGE to your Wallet

To view the balance of your wallet, and to obtain an address where you can deposit, you can use the `wallet` command by typing:

````
/wallet
````

At the Minecraft console prompt (Hotkey: T). From there, there will be a link to the address where you can send DOGE to be added in your wallet. It takes about 5 minutes for the balance to be refreshed and then you can use that for claiming land or purchasing materials.

## Transferring your balance out of the game

You can use the command `transfer`, to send the currency in your wallet to any DOGE wallet. The syntax is `transfer <amount> <address>` Example:

````
/transfer 100 nsDtTC8WbohYwfcXZGxs788BVFPfJXbfcn
````

This will send 100 DOGE to the address `nsDtTC8WbohYwfcXZGxs788BVFPfJXbfcn`. Please be careful while typing that command because the operation will be irreversible.

# Land

The land in the game world is divided into chunks. A chunk can be "claimed" by a player, who will be the owner of that chunk, meaning only they can build there.

You can visit chunks of other players but you won't be able to destroy blocks or use artifacts.

Land that is not claimed by any user will show up as "wilderness" and all players can build/destroy there.

## Claim land

The price of one chunk of land is 10 DOGE. If you have that amount on your wallet you can claim land using the `land claim` command plus the name of your terrain. For example:

````
/land claim Alice
````

Will claim the chunk on your current location and the land will be named "Alice". When other players get there, they won't be able to destroy or use any of the blocks placed in your chunk.

# Loot

When Killing mobs there is a chance of 'Loot', a small prize of cryptocurrency sent to your game wallet. The availability of loot depends on the balance of the game wallet, which is refilled every time a player purchases land.

Every time a player kills a mob, the balance of the game wallet is read, and if it's positive, there is a chance you'll earn some DOGE. The higher the level of the mob killed, the higher the amount in DOGE that will be awarded.

# Levels

When you join the server your character will be level 0. At this level, you only have 1 HP (1/2 Heart). You can level up by obtaining experience by Killing mobs. Each level gives you 1 extra HP until you reach the maximum level of 100.

Monsters also have levels, and higher level monsters are more difficult and have more health, but they also award higher experience.
